The ISIS project aims to provide a framework to access a large variety
of image processing libraries written in different programming
languages and environments. 

It's implemented in C++ and and extensible via a dynamic plugin
system. At the current state of development only I/O plugins, for
reading and writing image data files, are supported.

It can also be used as a python library. This feature is still
work in progress (see: ROADMAP).
